                        The launch of Luanda Security Services marked a revolutionary approach to the
                        increasingly challenging demands of domestic and industrial security in Kenya.As
                        armed crime continues to soar there is an urgent need to come up with new or
                        modern ways of deterring criminal activities and combating crime when it occurs.
                        Luanda Security Services was developed and responds to these challenges,thus
